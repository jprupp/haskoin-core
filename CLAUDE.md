# Instructions for Claude

## Keep the documentation up to date with every change

Every change to this repository must update all the documentation it affects,
in the same commit or pull request. A change is not finished until its
documentation is. Before you finish, check each of these and update what the
change touches:

- `README.md`: features, installation steps, examples, configuration,
  tutorials, module overview and caveats. Code examples must still compile
  against the new code, and version numbers in examples must name the current
  release.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: describe the change under the next version.
- Haddock in `src`.
- Module headers and declaration comments: add Haddock for every new
  declaration, and fix comments that the change made wrong.

If a change needs no documentation update, say so explicitly when you report
the change, with the reason.

## How to write documentation here

Documentation explains the purpose and spirit of the code, not only its
behaviour. For every module and every significant type or function, say what
problem it solves and why it is designed the way it is, including the trade-offs
and the alternatives it rejects. A reader should come away knowing when to use
it and when not to. Keep to the structure the README already has, and put new
material in the section where a reader would look for it.

## Checks

Build the documentation with `stack haddock --no-haddock-deps` and make sure it
has no warnings about broken markup. CI builds it too, both with the OS
libraries and with `stack --nix`.
